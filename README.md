### Problem/Issue:

Users are unable to view and modify bank accounts online. 

### Functionality:

Our simple banking application will allow users to view accounts through CLI. In addition, users can view and remove accounts, as well as deposit and withdraw. 

### Previous Works

We will be referencing a YT playlist by “Intro to Computer Science”, where he builds a simple banking application on NetBeans using Java Swing.

### More Information

Project will be monitored through GitHub. IDE’s are up to personal preference, but may include VS Code and Eclipse. 


### Plan and Approach

Each team member, per project guidelines, is expected to contribute to the programming aspect of the project. 

Responsibilities will be specified after further discussion, and will be done a voluntary basis to ensure each member is assigned to a portion where they are most comfortable and best suited. 

The project will be split into 4 major portions: Add/create account, delete account, withdraw, deposit. 

1. Add/create account
    * Users will be able to create a an account, with the option to create others.
2. Delete account
    * Users will be able to remove any of their accounts.
3. Withdraw
    * Users will be able to withdraw from a selected account. Overdraft fees will be enforced if withdrawal amount is greater than current amount in bank account.
4. Deposit
    * Users will be able to deposit an amount into a selected bank account. Amount is limited to $5000 per each deposit.
5. UML diagram
    * Diagram showing representing the architecture of the project.
   
Each issue will be worked on from a separate branch, and then pulled into the main branch once review is complete. 

**By Oct 31 midpoint:** Application will allow users to create and delete accounts. 

**By project deadline:** Users should then be able to withdraw and deposit from a selected account. Entire app should be fully functional. UML should be complete.
