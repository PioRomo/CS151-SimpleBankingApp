### Problem/Issue:

Users are unable to view and modify bank accounts online. 

### Functionality:

Our simple banking application will allow users to view accounts through GUI. In addition, users can view and remove accounts, as well as deposit and withdraw. 

### Previous Works

We will be referencing a YT playlist by “Intro to Computer Science”, where he builds a simple banking application on NetBeans using Java Swing.

### More Information

Project will be monitored through GitHub. IDE’s are up to personal preference, but may include VS Code and Eclipse. 


### Plan and Approach

Each team member will be responsible for at least one portion of the project. 
The project will be split into 4 major portions: Add account, delete account, withdraw, deposit. 
Each issue will be worked on from a separate branch, and then pulled into main once complete. 
By Oct 31 midpoint: GUI should be fully functional. Project should be able to allow users to add and remove accounts. 
By project deadline: Users should then be able to withdraw and deposit from a selected account.
